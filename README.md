## Why I Made This Project:

This was my first time making a custom ESP-32 SoC board, and I wanted to put it to good use. Initially, I decided to create this project to practice making SoC boards while tracking my bicycle speed. Over time, it evolved into a fully-fledged navigation system. I aim to provide a way to ride with information at your fingertips, all while minimizing distractions. The e-ink screen prevents glare from the sun and the custom UI limits distractions that would otherwise be caused by a phone.
